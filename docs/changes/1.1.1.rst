========================
Changes in version 1.1.1
========================

Bugfixes
========

* The public API for `~fabric.tasks.Task` mentioned use of the ``run()``
  method, but Fabric's main execution loop had not been updated to look for and
  call it, forcing users who subclassed `~fabric.tasks.Task` to define
  ``__call__()`` instead. This was an oversight and has been corrected.


Documentation
=============

* The documentation for use of `~fabric.tasks.Task` subclasses (contained under
  :ref:`new-style-tasks`) has been slightly fleshed out and has also grown an
  example snippet or two.
